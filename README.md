# BUSINESS-ANALYST-PROJECTS
Projects completed under the Business Analyst Nano Degree

Educational Objectives: This Nanodegree program prepares you for a career in predictive analytics, and
enables you to master a scientific approach to solving problems with data. You’ll build fluency in two leading
software packages: Alteryx, a tool that enables you to prepare, blend, and analyze data quickly; and Tableau,
a powerful data visualization tool. Over the course of the program, you’ll learn to:




Project: Predicting Diamond Prices 
A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it
should bid. In this project, you will use the results from a predictive model to make a recommendation on
how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds. You’ll submit this project in your first 7 days,
and by the end you’ll be able to:
➔ Understand the Data
➔ Visualize the Data
➔ Make a recommendation

Project: Predict Sales for a Catalog Launch 
A home-goods manufacturer wants to predict expected profits from a catalog launch. You will apply a
framework to work through the problem and build a linear regression model to provide results and a
recommendation.

➔ Identify and adjust for outliers
DATA FORMATTING
➔ Summarize, cross-tabulate, transpose, and reformat data to
prepare a dataset for analysis
DATA BLENDING 
➔ Join and union data from different sources and formats

Project: Predict Loan Default Risk (20 hrs)
A bank recently received an influx of loan applications. You will build and apply a classification model to
provide a recommendation on which loan applicants the bank should lend to. Supporting Lesson Content: Classification Models Lesson Title Learning Outcomes
CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS
➔ Understand the fundamentals of classification modeling and
how it differs from modeling numeric data
BINARY CLASSIFICATION MODELS
➔ Build logistic regression and decision tree models
➔ Use stepwise to automate predictor variables selection
➔ Score and compare models and interpret the results
NON-BINARY CLASSIFICATION MODELS
➔ Build and compare forest and boosted models and interpret their results
➔ Score and compare models and interpret the results

Project: A/B Test a New Menu Launch 
A chain of coffee shops is considering launching a new menu. You will design and analyze an A/B test and write up a recommendation on whether the chain should introduce the new menu.

Matched Pair Practice  
➔ Use trend and seasonality as control variables for a matched pair design A/B test

Practice Project: Forecast Video Game Demand 
A video game producer is planning production levels. You will use time series forecasting models to forecast
monthly demand and provide a recommendation to help match supply to demand.

Lesson Title Learning Outcomes
Fundamentals of Time Series Forecasting
➔ Understand trend, seasonal, and cyclical behavior of time series data
ETS Models 
➔ Use time series decomposition plots
➔ Build out an ETS model in Alteryx
ARIMA Models
➔ Stationarize data through differencing, a process that prepares data for ARIMA modeling
➔ Build out an ARIMA model in Alteryx Analyzing and Visualizing Results
➔ Use holdout samples to compare models and select the best one for a business problem
➔ Visualize your forecasts through various plots

Project: Combine Predictive Techniques 
A grocery store chain is planning a significant expansion. You will use multiple analytical techniques to provide recommendations on how to expand. After completing the project, you will feel comfortable combining predictive techniques and delivering results to complex business problems. Supporting Lesson Content:
